# Bryan-Mannix-Python movie cororolation project 
 In this project we will be working in Python to find correlations between variables. to do this, i downloaded a movie data set from kaggle that deals
 with many different variables. I thought it would be interesting to use tools within python to see what factor is the most influencial in ensuring a 
 movie makes a high gross profit.
