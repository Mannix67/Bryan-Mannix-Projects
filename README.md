#Analysing Data using Python pandas and finding the biggest correlation for making the most gross profit.

In this project I worked in Python to find correlations between variables while using a movie data set from Kaggle. I chose this data set because i thought it would 
be interesting to see what facor impacts a filims total gross profit while using the skills i learned on udemy. 

I started the project by cleaning the data to make the data easier to read and work with.
